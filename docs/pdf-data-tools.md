# 📊 PDF Data Tools – Extract, Analyze, and Convert PDF Files

PDF files are one of the most common document formats used for reports, invoices, statements, and official documents.  
However, working with **data inside PDFs** can be frustrating.

Tables break, text loses structure, and manual copy-paste wastes time.

This repository/article explains what **PDF Data Tools** are and how they help you turn static PDFs into usable data.

## 🔍 What Are PDF Data Tools?

PDF data tools are utilities designed to:

- Extract **text** from PDF files
- Detect and extract **tables and structured data**
- Convert PDF content into editable formats such as:
  - Excel (`.xlsx`)
  - CSV (`.csv`)
  - Plain text (`.txt`)
- Reuse PDF data without retyping or formatting issues

They are commonly used by developers, analysts, accountants, researchers, and students.

## ❌ Why Copy & Paste Fails with PDFs

PDF files are built for **visual consistency**, not for data manipulation.

Common problems include:

- Broken table rows and columns
- Merged numbers and text
- Lost formatting when pasting into Excel
- Scanned PDFs with no selectable text

This makes manual extraction unreliable and time-consuming.

They can:

- Detect table boundaries
- Preserve rows and columns
- Convert numerical data correctly
- Handle large files efficiently

Most tools also include automatic file deletion for privacy.
